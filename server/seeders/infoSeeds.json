                "description": "<h6>The Center for Spatial Studies and Data Science (@Spatial) was founded in July 2007 through an initiative by Professor Michael Goodchild. The vision of a Center for Spatial Studies was developed by a special committee that met in the first few months of 2007 with a mandate to consider the state of spatial thinking, data, and tools across the campus. The committee recommended the establishment of a center whose primary objective would be to develop spatial thinking as an approach to scholarship, supporting its use across the entire range of disciplines at UCSB.</h6>\n<h6>Upon Professor Goodchild’s retirement in July 2012, Mary Hegarty (Dept. of Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences) served as interim director from 2012 to 2013, until Werner Kuhn was appointed Chair of the Jack and Laura Dangermond Endowment, director of @Spatial, and professor in the Dept. of Geography. Briefly, @Spatial provided several innovative educational resources and services to the academic community at UCSB and beyond. These included a consulting service (the GIS Help Desk) and two seminar series (ThinkSpatial and Spatial Technology Lunches); community outreach (most notably an annual poster and plenary session, spatial@ucsb.local); office space for students and visitors; student internships; a Specialist Meeting series; a new series of Spatial Un-conferences (participant-driven meetings); a Minor in Spatial Studies; and a Freshman Seminar in Thinking Spatially in the Arts and Sciences. These offerings helped enrich the resources at UCSB for spatially-enabled research and contributed to developing a strong interdisciplinary thread of spatial studies and broadening undergraduate and graduate educational opportunities.</h6>\n<h6>After focusing on raising awareness (2008–2012), on introducing spatially-enabled knowledge infrastructures (2013–2016), and on spatially enabled and sensor-driven smart communities (2017–2020), @Spatial was well positioned to address a new cross-cutting theme. Under its former director, Dr. Krzysztof Janowicz (2020-2023), @Spatial shifted its focus to Spatial Data Science and Knowledge Graphs, thereby also connecting more closely to a campus emphasis that had steadily grown over @Spatial’s past funding period. More specifically, @Spatial focused on spatiotemporally explicit machine learning models operating on these graphs.</h6>\n<h6>Since 2023, @Spatial has been led by Professor Trisalyn Nelson and has continued to establish its presence as a premier research center in Geographic Information Sciences. The leadership team has expanded to include Professor Nelson (Director), Professor Somayeh Dodge (Associate Director), Professor Alan Murray (Associate Director), Professor Amy Frazier (Core Faculty), and Professor Peter Kedron (Core Faculty). This cohesive team integrates geographic information systems, spatial analysis, coding, statistics, optimization, and remote sensing for the analysis of spatial data. Through strategic partnerships on campus and within industry partnerships, they advance @Spatial’s mission to propel spatial data science at UC Santa Barbara by leading interdisciplinary discovery, education, and access to actionable solutions.</h6>"

However, many countries struggle to meet these targets due to insufficient analytical support for local land use planning and a disconnect between scientific geographic information and on-the-ground decision-making. Additionally, achieving multiple spatial planning goals—such as biodiversity, carbon reduction, and habitat restoration—across fragmented administrative agencies presents significant challenges.</h6><h6>To address these issues, the Center for Spatial Studies and Data Science has collaborated with global conservation organizations to explore how a geographic approach leveraging GIScience can better support conservation efforts. Key needs identified include increasing GIS capacity in resource-constrained organizations, integrating emerging geospatial technologies while addressing ethical considerations, creating spatial data infrastructure for evidence-based analysis, and tracking the conservation impacts of private actors.</h6><h6>In December 2024, the Center will host colleagues in conservation and GIScience to a two-day meeting at UCSB in Santa Barbara, where we will outline research priorities, develop collaborative programs, and discuss training opportunities. This workshop aims to catalyze a broader initiative to enhance GIScience in support of 21st-century conservation needs.</h6>",
